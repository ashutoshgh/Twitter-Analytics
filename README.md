# Twitter-Analytics

This repository comprises of the code used to do a simple Twitter sentiment analysis. Just choose a hashtag that you want to target and you can specify the start and the end date between which all the tweets will get downloaded.
You can also specify the total number of tweets to be downloaded.

The first half focuses on downloading the tweets and the second half focuses on cleaning the text and performing the sentiment analysis.
